# React hook visualizer

This is a prototype for a React dataflow visualizer, mostly supporting some basic framer-motion hooks as a proof of concept.

It is a VSCode extension and has a basic parser that runs every time `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument`, and a `WebviewPanel` that refreshes based on what's detected.
